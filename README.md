It gives unlimited storage and a maximum of 5TB single file upload. Amazon S3 provides a safe and secured storage facility over the cloud with a number of features like partitioning, replication, fault tolerance and elastic scalability. It offers pay for the storage that is actually used and gives flexibility of who can access the data with Identity and Access Management policies, access control list, bucket policies and query string authentication. It also helps to securely upload and download data with SSL encrypted end points and provides multiple options of encrypting data at rest.
